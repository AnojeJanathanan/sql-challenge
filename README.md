# sql-challenge

This assignment serves the purpose of a research project dedicated towards the people that Pewlett Hackard has employed during the 1980s and 1990s for analytical purposes. In addition, by first importing this dataset into SQL, I will then showcase the Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Final Analysis Phases with specific insights into employee statistics. 1.) Data Modeling: Entity Relationship AND Table Schema for All Tables Will Be Provided. 2.) Data Engineering: Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, NOT NULL Conditions, and Value Length Parameters Will Be Set. 3.) Data Analysis: Final Questions/Insights will be answered/extracted. 


FYI: I Dumped my original Schemata from PgAdmin, however, it did not show 'references
. Furthermore, I used ChatGPT to edit my schemata to show the references. I have uploaded both schemas, my original schema via database dump and the new schema that has been altered using ChatGPT.
